      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I want to be a web developer because I am ready to challenge myself by learning technical skills for a professional career.  I've enjoyed making websites on wix and weebly, but these sites are very limited in their functionality and do not seem professional.  I want to be able to develop reliable, functional, and professional web applications for my own businesses and for employeers and other clients .  </p>
